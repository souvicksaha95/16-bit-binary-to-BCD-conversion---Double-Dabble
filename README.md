# 16-bit-binary-to-BCD-conversion---Double-Dabble
By this module we can convert a 16 bit Binary number to BCD. This code is written in verilog using shift and add 3 algorithm, which is also known as Double Dabble algorithm. Look at the simulation result in GTKwave. Ex - (0947)H is equal to 2375 in BCD
